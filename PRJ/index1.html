            <p>Banks have long known that if they can capture the attention of customers when
                they are young, they are likely to get hold of them for life. For this reason,
                they have always been quick to jump on new and emerging trends, and today’s hot
                tech potato – the metaverse – is certainly no exception.</p>

            <p>Generation Z consumers are fully digital-native – online is the default option
                for them when they go looking for the products and services they need. The
                metaverse – persistent, immersive digital environments that potentially offer
                everything we need to live our lives digitally, under one roof – provides new
                ways for businesses to connect with customers. Banks, as ever, have been keen to
                capitalize on it.
            </p>
            <p>If you need a bit more information on what the metaverse is, and what it promises
                for the future, you can take a look at my Easy Explanation for
                    Anyone article. Otherwise, let’s dive in and take a look at how
                banks and other financial services organizations are making their mark there:
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Virtual Lobbies :-</strong></h3>
            <p>One of the most obvious uses of the metaverse, as far as retail banks are
                concerned, is to create “virtual branches” where they can sell banking products
                to a new breed of digitally-native gen-z consumers, or provide customer service
                to their existing customers.
            </p>
            <p>Emerging metaverse platforms like and Decentraland attract
                hundreds of thousands of visitors each month, while established gaming platforms
                with metaverse-like functionality, such as Roblox or Fortnite, can attract
                millions. Their audiences are digital natives and are keen to do business with
                companies that share their understanding and enthusiasm for virtual worlds and
                gaming-style environments.
            </p>
            <p>Among those who have been first to set up virtual storefronts is HSBC,
                which in The Sandbox earlier
                this year, which it will use to engage with online sports fans and e-sports
                enthusiasts. It's CMO for the Asia Pacific region, Suresh Balaji said, "At HSBC,
                we see great potential to create new experiences through emerging platforms,
                opening up a world of opportunity for our current and future customers and the
                communities we serve.” Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank also has a on The Sandbox platform.
            </p>
            <p>JP Morgan Chase is another global banking giant that has already established
                by setting up shop on the
                Decentraland platform. It created a lounge area called Onyx inside the
                platform's Metajuku virtual mall, which gives visitors information about
                blockchain and other technology-driven initiatives that the bank is taking part
                in. It also features a tiger and a portrait of the company CEO, Jamie Dimon.</p>
            <p>This trend is actually not as new as it seems, however. Linden Labs’ Second Life
                is often cited as one of the first metaverse environments, having been in
                existence since 2003. A few years later, in 2007, Danish investment bank
                Saxoon the platform,
                with many of the features that today’s metaverse bankers are building, such as
                the ability to interact and communicate via avatars.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Bridging the gap between virtual economies and real economies :-</strong></h3>
            <p>With spending in the metaverse expected to by 2030, it’s big business,
                and banks are already thinking about the profits that will be made by moving
                money and perhaps other assets between the digital and physical worlds.</p>
            <p>Metaverse platforms allow users to buy virtual goods – including sneakers from
                Nike and clothes from Gucci – to decorate their avatars and their virtual homes.
                Money can be earned in online play-to-earn games such as Axie Infinity. This usually
                involves dealing in cryptocurrencies and unique digital assets like.
                 Transferring this money into the real world
                involves exchanging it for real currencies, which are paid into a bank account.
            </p>
            <p>Startup which calls itself the “bank of the
                metaverse” – offers regulated services for transferring money between virtual
                worlds and the real world, as well as trading valuable in-game items between
                players.</p>
                <h3><strong>It’s all about image :-</strong></h3>
                <p>So, is banking in the metaverse just another fad that will die out as consumers
                    lose interest? Well, with actual physical bank branches closing down at
                    an it makes sense that
                    financial institutions may well be looking to the metaverse and virtual worlds
                    as a way of maintaining connection with customers and providing basic banking
                    services.</p>
                <p>It's also clear that virtual economies, and the trade in virtual goods and
                    services, are set to grow. As today's younger generation of consumers grows up
                    and wants to bank and engage with financial services in environments they feel
                    comfortable in, it seems likely that virtual environments will provide a
                    familiar platform for them to do just that.</p>
                <p>It's true that no one really knows exactly what the metaverse is yet, much less
                    what it will look like in five or ten years' time. However, it's clear that
                    banking and finance feel that it will be an important part of our lives and want
                    to make sure they are a part of it, too.
